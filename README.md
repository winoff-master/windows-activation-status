# How to Check Windows Activation Status
To verify activation:
1. Go to Settings → **System** → **Activation**.
2. You'll see either:
- *Windows is activated with a digital license*, or
- *Activation required* if it's not activated.
You can also run in Command Prompt:
```
slmgr /xpr
```
> **Good to Know:** Activated Windows allows full updates and feature support.
